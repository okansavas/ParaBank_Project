# ParaSoft/Parabank Project

## Project Description:

  Parabank is a virtual banking application that represents a simulated environment for testing and simulating financial transactions. It is not a real financial institution 
  but is used in place of a real banking application during software testing. 
  
The test environments provided above are designed for performing various operations that users can execute in a web-based banking application. They are valuable tools for simulating financial transactions such as account creation, money transfers, credit application submissions,
and bill payments. They are utilized for implementing various test scenarios.
